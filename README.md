hi this is a github pages site i made for badly written 3ds guides written by me

-> MOST OF THESE HAVE BEEN MOVED TO THE [HACKS GUIDE WIKI](https://wiki.hacks.guide/). THIS REPO SERVES AS AN ARCHIVE OF THE ORIGINAL (that i may add to periodically). <-

link to site is [here](https://redkerry135.github.io/home/)  

feel free to make a pr if something's bad and you want to fix it

i plan on archiving this at some point and remaking it at a later date
